# Exress, Angular & Node seed project

This is a seed project for node web application leveraging express and angular.  Diving into the MEAN stack over at 
https://github.com/linnovate/mean can be a bit daunting, esspecially when you're new to node in general.  I found that
a lot of the middleware they use obscures the basics, so I set about building my domain knowledge from the ground up
with this seed project.  All it does is provide some boilerplate package files and basic file structure; reading through 
the code and the angular/express docs for a a few hours will bring anyone up to speed.  

The more I learn the more I will adobt the various popular technologies (like grunt & mongo), but this is the starting point.
